	<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

	<p>
		The Dyne.org Tech Radar is a list of technologies, organised by a criteria of maturity / usefulness / reliability which can be compared to a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level">TRL</a>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purposes, also in large scale. Technologies developed by us or with an established usage culture in our Dyne.org production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.</li>
<li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some people in our community walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.</li>
<li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and unproven in our organisation. You will find some people that have knowledge in the technology and promote it.</li>
<li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies we know enough to think they are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
</ul>

</td><td>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support people around the Dyne.org community to pick the best technologies for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape.
</p>

<h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

<p>
This Tech Radar is maintained by an open group of senior Dyne.org developers committed to devote time to the Tech Radar purpose. Assignment of technologies to rings is the outcome of open discussions on our community channels (mailinglists, chats, etc). The Tech Radar depends on active participation and input from all developers at Dyne.org.
</p>

<p>
	<em>BTW, if you would like to create your own Tech Radar &mdash; <a href="https://github.com/dyne/tech-radar">the code is open source</a> and it can be used to generate another visualization like this one.</em>
